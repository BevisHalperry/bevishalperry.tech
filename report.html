<h1>Bevis Halsey-Perry Report: IS51018A Large Coursework</h1>

<p><strong>Link to my website:</strong> <a href="doc.gold.ac.uk/~bhals001/bevishalperry">doc.gold.ac.uk/~USERNAME/edit/this/path</a></p>

<p><strong>State 3 things that have inspired you when creating your website.</strong>
     These could include guest speakers, other websites, artists, developers etc.</p>

<ul>
    <li>
        The minimalist website-design trend of horizontal slices layout (such as <a href="figma.com">figma.com</a>), which provides an easy way of handling responsiveness. 
    </li>
    <li>
        At an UX workshop at Anvil Hack this year, there was a heated discussion over good and bad UX over given examples in slides. Inspired by the comments of fellow participants, with experience, I did my best in building this website without any visual discomfort.  
    </li>
    <li>
        My projects. Since it is my portfolio website, it is only natural to reach for inspiration from its content. Thus, the header has lights, just like my hat, it is made in Javascript, just like the film scroller and it has a stable layout, like my printer.
    </li>
</ul>

<p><strong>State 3 ways in which your site is accessible.</strong></p>

<ul>
    <li>Automatically generating alt tags for project cards list using name of project</li>
    <li>Used high contrast colours in different sections and white text on dark background</li>
    <li> modified tabindex to ensure links work in the correct order</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>State 3 ways in which you have considered usability in your site.</strong></p>

<ul>
    <li> Made a single page site, using links to scroll points. It is very unnecessary  
    to create a multi page website for a small portfolio website. </li>
    <li> Used a set palette of colours which I defined in application.less to give the site a consistant style </li>
    <li> Made the website repsonsive</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>State 3 things you had to learn/find out by yourself when creating your site, and describe how you did that</strong> 
    (i.e. what searches you did, any new tools/techniques you learned, any changes/adaptations you made to a particular resource to make it work with your site).</p>

<ul>
    <li> 
        Advanced Styling: I learned LESS, the css preprocessor. I usually use SASS, but wanted to try something new and liked I could use it with
        out any build tools as it can compile client-side using less.js, very useful for low-key devlopment. I just used the LESS docs to learn.
        I tried to learn the BEM methodology, and incorperate a few of the rules into the LESS, it helped to structure a lot of the styling and make it
        very DRY, I can see this method being very useful for large projects.
    </li>
    <li>
        Accessability: I learned how tabindex works for screen readers and how to make it work well within a page, its not always obvious and a lot of browsers
        have strange default behavior, like tabindex always starting with the input forms. Found that tabindex has to be daclared in the parent object to override this bug
    </li>
    <li>
        Forms: I learned how Formspree works and how to implement it. Its incredibly well built and very easy to implement.
        I also read about how to host your own Formspree server.
    </li>

</ul>

<p><strong>What changes did you make to your site in response to the feedback you received for your first submission?</strong> 
    Feedback was shared with you on the department intranet. If this is your first submisison, just write, `Not applicable'.</p>

<p>NOT APPLICABLE</p>

<p><strong>Are there any other changes you made which you feel have improved the site?</strong> If so, explain why you decided to make the changes, and how they have improved the site. If this is your first submission, tell us here what you think has gone well with your submission.</p>

<ul>
    <li>
        UX/UI: I feel the minimalism of the site is clean and functional with a strong consistant colour scheme.
        I think this went very well and achived the look I was going for. I like the big hero as I think it suits a personal site. Just Name, Tag and Contact link.
        with the esponsiveness I tried to implement this from scratch, which I think went ok. Im proud of using media qierys effectivly.
    </li>
    <li>
        Automation: I wanted to try and begin to implement a kind of an automated template system for the portfolio, so I created a javascript system that 
        automatically creates the HTML from a javascript object.
    </li>
    <li>
        Forms: I like how formspree works and the way I implemented it.
    </li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Are there any aspect(s) of your work that could still be improved, and if so, how might you achieve this?</strong> If this is your first submission, tell us here what you feel the weaknesses of the project are, and how you might do things differently another time.</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Would probably play with the alignments on the portfolio entities, making sure they are presented in an interactive, easy way. Thus, the user would be invited to dive through my professional achievements.
        I would probably use flexbox or use a grid library like neat sass to improve repos
    </li>
    <li>
        I want to take the portfolio automation further by using github, devpost and hackster APIs to auto fill the projects object.
    </li>
</ul>

<p><strong>What resources were used when creating your work?</strong> You should list here any sources of information, libraries, plug-ins or other code that you used to create your site. You should also reference any code you've used by inserting comments at the start of the scripts.</p>
